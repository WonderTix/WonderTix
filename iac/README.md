### Terraform CLI Commands
`terraform init`
Initializes a Terraform working directory by downloading and configuring the required providers and modules.
`terraform plan`
Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to change the infrastructure to match the configuration.
`terraform apply`
Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by an execution plan.
`terraform import`
Imports an existing infrastructure into your Terraform state, allowing you to manage pre-existing resources with Terraform.
- Usage example: `terraform import <TERRAFORM_RESOURCE_TYPE>.<RESOURCE_NAME> <RESOURCE_ID>`

`terraform state`
Provides advanced state management options, allowing you to view, modify, or remove resources within the Terraform state file.
- Usage example: `terraform state <subcommand>`

`terraform fmt`
Automatically formats Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style.
`terraform validate`
Validates the syntax and structure of the Terraform configuration files, ensuring they are properly formatted and logically correct.
`terraform output`
Displays the outputs defined in the Terraform configuration, useful for extracting useful information or passing data to other tools.
`terraform refresh`
Updates the Terraform state to reflect the current state of the infrastructure, without making any changes to the infrastructure itself.
`terraform show`
Provides human-readable output from a state or plan file, showing the resources that will be created, updated, or destroyed.

### Project Structure
- `main.tf`: Contains the main set of resource configurations for the project.
- `variables.tf`: Defines variables used across the project.
- `outputs.tf`: Defines outputs after Terraform execution.

### Environment Configuration
- Ensure your GCP credentials are set up by exporting your service account key:
```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/credentials-file.json"
```

### Common Workflows
- **Planning Changes:** Before applying changes, always run `terraform plan` to review what will be created, updated, or destroyed.
- **Applying Changes:** Execute `terraform apply` to apply the desired changes to your infrastructure.
- **Destroying Infrastructure:** Use `terraform destroy` when you need to completely remove all resources managed by Terraform.

### Best Practices
- **State Management:** Store Terraform state in a remote backend such as Google Cloud Storage to improve security and team collaboration.
- **Sensitive Information:** Use variables and secrets management practices to handle sensitive information, never hard-code credentials.
- **Version Control:** Use version control for your Terraform files to track changes and collaborate with team members.

### Troubleshooting
- **Initialization Errors:** If `terraform init` fails, check your network connection and access rights to the backend.
- **Plan and Apply Errors:** Ensure all required variables are supplied and that your GCP credentials are up-to-date.

### Version Control Integration
- **Repository Setup:** Ensure Terraform configurations are stored in a version-controlled repository to track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Branching Strategy:** Use feature branches for new changes, merge them into main/master through pull requests.
- **Commit Guidelines:** Write clear, concise commit messages that explain why and what changes were made.

### Dependency Management
- **Using Modules:** Utilize Terraform modules to reuse code for similar infrastructure setups. Specify the module source and version in your configuration files.
- **Updating Modules:** Regularly update your modules to the latest versions to incorporate improvements and security patches.

### Performance Optimization
- **State Locking:** Use remote state with state locking to prevent conflicts during concurrent operations.
- **Parallelism:** Adjust the parallelism level of Terraform operations to speed up execution without overloading your systems.

### Testing and Validation
- **Static Code Analysis:** Use tools like `terraform validate` and `tflint` to catch errors and enforce best practices.
- **Integration Testing:** Implement automated testing that applies changes to a test environment before production.

### Managing Variables with `.tfvars` Files

- **Creating `.tfvars` Files:**
  Store environment-specific variables in separate `.tfvars` files, such as `dev.tfvars` for development and `prod.tfvars` for production environments.

- **Populating `.tfvars` Files:**
  Provide actual values for your Terraform configurations in these files. Keep sensitive information out of version control by referencing these files without tracking them in Git.

- **Using `.tfvars` Files in Commands:**
  Specify which `.tfvars` file to use with Terraform commands using the `-var-file` flag:
  ```sh
  terraform apply -var-file="path/to/your-file.tfvars"
```
