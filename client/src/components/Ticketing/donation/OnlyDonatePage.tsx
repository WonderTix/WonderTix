          <p className='py-2'>Dear Friends,</p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            I am eternally grateful for my relationship with Portland Playhouse.
            As their 15th Anniversary Season comes to a close,
            <b>
              I ask that you consider deepening your support of this organization
              and the artists who create here.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            I&lsquo;ve felt so supported by the way the Playhouse runs their
            business.  Talk is cheap, right? But when a situation comes up to
            where that talk has to be put into action,
            <b>
              Portland Playhouse lives their values and puts the individual first.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            They&lsquo;ve created an environment where artists can show up as
            their whole selves. I don&lsquo;t have to leave pieces of my life at
            the stage door.  My husband and daughter are welcome in rehearsals,
            and I see the children of other actors around, playing or doing their
            homework. It&lsquo;s not chaotic or unprofessional. Your family&lsquo;s
            there and the work still gets done.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            <b>
              As an institution, they speak from a place of trust and they hold
              on to their word.
            </b>
            If they don&lsquo;t get it right, they ask - where did we mess up?
            How can we do better? How can we move forward? Thats what I love
            about them. Tey are forever evolving, forever growing.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            <b>
              Please help Portland Playhouse continue to grow by donating
              generously today.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            Sincerely,
          </p>
